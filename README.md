# Bottle-Exchange-Scotch-Whisky-Cask-Project

## Overview
Whisky casks are growing as a investment oppertunity for the general public and consumers. With casks ranging from several hundreds to tens of thousands of pounds, this significantly reduces the possibility of the general public having the ability to risk significant savings or simply afford to invest within scotch whisky at all.

The Project will consist in creating a prototype platform allowing consumers to purchase a share within a whisky cask. Consumers will be able to purchase a share of a whisky cask which in future will be auctioned off and each consumer will receive the percentage of the funds they owned through the cask giving a significant increase in the general public having the ability to invest within the Scotch whisky market.
