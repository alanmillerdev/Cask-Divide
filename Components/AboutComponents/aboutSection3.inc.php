      <p class="lead">We operate as a cask sharing option giving you the opportunity to own a share of a whisky cask at a significantly reduced cost whilst still having the benefit of owning a cask. This not only removes the extensive financial commitment of owning a cask as a whole but gives you the opportunity to purchase as many shares in as many different casks as you like.<br><br> Our single payment service gives you the ability to purchase your cask without the need to constantly monitor the whisky market to look for the best time to sell. Our casks are held then sold as a whole via online auction so there is no bottling or shipping charges to consider. Cask holdings will vary in timescales giving you the option to invest as a short or mid-term investment, this gives you the freedom to invest according to your needs
